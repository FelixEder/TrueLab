# TrueLab
My final project in the internet programming course at KTH.

The idea was to create a Tinder-like web-application in which you could log in and match with potential lab-partners or similar in order to find people with similar ambition and similar (a task that can be diffcult based on our own experience.)

#### Tech:
###### Front-end:
AngularJS, HTML, CSS


###### Back-end:
Node.js, Express, MySQL, Sequelize

The project is over but it didn't quite turn out as we wanted it to, so we will maybe continue to work on the project in the future.

#### Possible extra features thought of but never implemented:

  * Swipe animation
  * Admin page where teachers (or similar) can add/edit courses and other relevant information regarding them.
  * Groups for courses with groups with more than 2 people
  * Chat-prompt when a message/tip about what you can say to a person when you matched with them and open up the chat for the first time
  * Native app (Android/iOS)
  * Be able to login with your KTH-account (and more universities if possible)
  * Be able to add a picture to your profile (which will also be seen in the swiper-part)
